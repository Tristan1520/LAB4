    <p>This page includes a list of the coolest characters ever created in fiction. There is no particular order to this list,
        but the character on top is there for a reason. Each character has their own traits that make them unique in their own ways,
        but they all have one thing in common. They're cooler than any non-fictional character could ever be, as they are not defined by the restraints
        of the real world.
